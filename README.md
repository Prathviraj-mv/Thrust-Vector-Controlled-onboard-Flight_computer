# Actively stabilised TVC-Flight_controller


This project is a fully functional Thrust Vector Control (TVC) flight computer designed for model rocketry applications. The system uses real-time data from onboard sensors to stabilize and control the rocket's trajectory during flight by adjusting the angle of the thrust vector.

Features
Sensor Integration: Real-time data acquisition from IMU (e.g., MPU6050) for pitch, roll, and yaw measurements and barometric pressure sensors (e.g., BMP180) for altitude tracking.
Control Mechanism: Servo-based thrust vectoring for precise control of the rocket's orientation.
Data Logging: Logs flight data (altitude, angles, etc.) onboard for post-flight analysis.
